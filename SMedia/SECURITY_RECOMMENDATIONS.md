# Security Recommendations for Production Environment

The current configuration is optimized for development and debugging. Before deploying to production, please address the following security considerations:

## JWT Authentication

1. **Re-enable token validation**: 
   - In `Program.cs`, restore proper token validation:
   ```csharp
   options.TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
   {
       ValidateIssuer = true,
       ValidateAudience = true,
       ValidateLifetime = true,
       ValidateIssuerSigningKey = true,
       ValidIssuer = jwtConfig.Issuer,
       ValidAudience = jwtConfig.Audience,
       IssuerSigningKey = new SymmetricSecurityKey(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(jwtConfig.Key))
   };
   ```

2. **Token Generation Improvements**:
   - Increase token lifespan for better user experience (current tokens expire after 7 days)
   - Store refresh tokens in a secure database for token renewal
   - Add claims for user roles and permissions

3. **Environment Variables**:
   - Ensure JWT_ISSUER, JWT_AUDIENCE, and JWT_KEY are properly set in production environments
   - Use Azure Key Vault or similar services for storing secrets in production

## Debugging

1. **Remove Debug Headers**:
   - Remove all debug headers in production to avoid leaking sensitive information:
     - X-Auth-Debug
     - X-Auth-User-ID
     - X-User-Exists
   - Implement proper logging instead of exposing debugging info in HTTP responses
   
2. **Secure Claim Handling**:
   - Consistently use standard claim types where possible (e.g., ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier)
   - If using custom claim names, document them thoroughly and use constants to avoid typos

## General API Security

1. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of the API
   - Consider using AspNetCoreRateLimit package

2. **HTTPS**:
   - Enforce HTTPS in production
   - Add HSTS headers

3. **CORS**:
   - Restrict CORS to specific origins in production

## Database

1. **Connection String**:
   - Store connection strings securely using environment variables or key vault
   - Use managed identities for database access in Azure

2. **Query Optimization**:
   - Add indexes to fields used in WHERE clauses for better performance
   - Consider pagination improvements with keyset pagination for large datasets

## Logging and Monitoring

1. **Implement proper logging**:
   - Log authentication failures with appropriate detail level
   - Track suspicious activities
   - Implement monitoring for security events

2. **Health checks**:
   - Add health check endpoints to monitor system status

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Short term** (before production):
   - Re-enable token validation with appropriate settings
   - Remove debug headers
   - Enforce HTTPS

2. **Medium term** (within 1-2 months):
   - Implement proper token refresh mechanism
   - Add rate limiting
   - Improve CORS policy

3. **Long term** (within 3-6 months):
   - Complete logging and monitoring infrastructure
   - Implement user roles and permissions
   - Regular security audits
